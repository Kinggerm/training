# Welcome to plant genomics training

## What's here?

This website contains training, resources and links for plant genomics and bioinformatics.

The website is under development and will expand over the next three years.

**We welcome your contributions!** In particular, we are looking for tutorials covering concepts, software, and workflows for common analyses in plant genomics. If you have any that you wish to share, or any corrections or suggestions for the website, please email anna.syme<code>@</code>rbg.vic.gov.au.
