## A software problem

* For command line tools, read the user documentation (this may be in the README on the code repository page).
* At the command line, try typing in any of these for information about inputs and options:
    * `toolname`
    * `toolname -h`
    * `toolname --help`
* Some tools have groups on Slack, Gitter or Google that can be very responsive to questions.
* If the code is on GitHub, file an Issue (second tab at the top)
