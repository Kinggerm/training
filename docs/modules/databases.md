# Databases

## Overview

* This page has links to databases for sequences, tools, workflows and plants.
* Some of these databases are for one plant species only; some are for a selection of species with tools to compare genome features.
* Most of these databases are linked to at least one other database by inputs or outputs.
* Databases are sometimes abandoned - look at the most recent update/release or news on the start page to find out if it is current. The ones in the links below seem to be active.
* There is no single standard repository for annotated genomes: these are held across various databases.
