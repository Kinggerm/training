<h5 id="what-is-genome-assembly">What is genome assembly?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Genome assembly is the process of joining together DNA sequencing fragments into longer pieces, ideally up to chromosome lengths.</li>
<li>The DNA fragments are produced by DNA sequencing machines, and are called &ldquo;reads&rdquo;. These are in lengths of about 150 base pairs, to up to a million (or more) base pairs, depending on the sequencing technology used. Currently, most reads are from Illumina (short), PacBio (long) or Oxford Nanopore (long and extra-long).</li>
<li>It is difficult to assemble plant genomes as they are often large (for example, 3,000,000,000 base pairs), have many repeat regions (such as transposons), and may be polyploid.</li>
<li>This tutorial shows genome assembly for a smaller data set - the plant chloroplast genome - a circular chromosome about 160,000 base pairs long.</li>
<li>The process shown here is applicable to assembling plant nuclear genomes but there would be extra steps (and much more time) involved. For example, additional sequencing would usually be run on 10X, BioNano or HiC to produce information to link up longer nuclear chromosome pieces and to separate out the maternal and paternal haplotypes.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="tutorial-overview">Tutorial overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>The chloroplast genome of the sweet potato has been sequenced.</li>
<li>This has produced many sequencing reads - DNA fragments.</li>
<li>We will try to join these reads together to make the whole chloroplast genome sequence.</li>
<li>We will use the Galaxy Australia platform (a web page) to run our analysis.</li>
<li>This tutorial assumes some familiarity with Galaxy and bioinformatics - if you are new to either of these, we recommend the <a href="https://galaxy-au-training.github.io/tutorials/">Galaxy Australia Training</a> tutorials <em>Get started, Learn key tasks, Quality control, Genome assembly, </em>and<em> Genome annotation</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="import-the-data">Import the data</h5>
<ul>
<li>Log in to <a href="https://usegalaxy.org.au/">Galaxy Australia</a> and create a new history.</li>
<li>The data is from this paper: <a href="https://doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.12856.1">Zhou C, Duarte T, Silvestre R et al. 2018</a>, hosted at EBI ENA.</li>
</ul>

How I got these files:
Created history: sweet potato chloroplast tutorial data

Nanopore data
Galaxy: Get data: EBI SRA:
enter in search box: SRR6828567
click on the link under run
under FASTQ files (Galaxy) click on File 1
will upload into current history

repeat for Illumina data: SRR6828568
note this data says paired but there is only one file.
these don't look paired, I uncompressed and looked at the last reads in the file and they are numbered xxx/1
probably ok to use though as just using for correction

Renamed.
Uncompressed (don't know what this tool is or how to find it in tools).
Reduced.
Very reduced (for a bam example).

the paper used slightly diff assembly method, which included correcting nanopore reads with illumina reads, trimming low qual, assembling nano with canu, then polish with pilon and illumina.

=> illumina file
[I found this by ncbi - looking at the Tanzania sample (see paper supp table S1) that gave the nanopore file (which is easy to find bc only one nanopore file in the set, but lots of illumina) - then searched for all reads under under this, and found the accompanying illumina file.

I've cut down the size of these datasets and hosted the data on Zenodo (with permission from author Lachlan Coin) at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3567224
-->

<ul>
<li>Original FASTQ reads: illumina (SRR6828568) and nanopore (SRR6828567).</li>
<li>These data sets have been highly reduced in size for this tutorial.</li>
<li>
<p>In a new browser tab, go to this webpage <a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3567224">at this link</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the file called <fn>mutant_R1.fastq</fn></p>
</li>
<li>Right click on file name: select &ldquo;copy link address&rdquo;</li>
<li>In Galaxy, go to <ss>Get Data</ss> and then Upload File</li>
<li>Click <ss>Paste/Fetch data</ss></li>
<li>A box will appear: paste in link address</li>
<li>Click <ss>Start</ss></li>
<li>Click <ss>Close</ss></li>
<li>The file will now appear in the top of your history panel.</li>
<li>Repeat for <fn>mutant_R2.fastq</fn>.</li>
<li>We now have tow FastQ read files in our history.</li>
<li>Click on the eye icon next to one of the FASTQ sequence files.</li>
<li>View the file in the centre Galaxy panel.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="look-at-the-read-quality">Look at the read quality</h5>
<ul>
<li>In the tool panel, search for Nanoplot</li>
<li>[to do - run details]</li>
<li>[to do - results] what does it mean, see sweet potato nanoplot - why is weighted histogram of read lengths have some that are in negative??</li>
<li>eg NanoStats
average read length = 7000
av quality = 10
2000 reads
13 million bases</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="assemble-the-nanopore-reads">Assemble the nanopore reads</h5>
<ul>
<li>In the tool panel, search for ?Assembly? or flye</li>
<li>leave settings as default; add genome size 160000</li>
<li>rename scaffolds as flye.fasta</li>
<li>
<p>Click <ss>Execute</ss></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>view outputs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>in summary: three contigs, one of these is in two directions; then joins these together.</p>
<p>1/ scaffolds (2 contigs): re-name flye.fasta
2/ info (contigs as above, but shows the parts within these contigs)
3/ graph_dot (what&rsquo;s connected - eg1-&gt;0-&gt;3-&gt;2-&gt;1)
4/ gfa (seqs: contigs 1 2 and 3 and connecting info). 5/ log. can see that the order of doing stuff is: write fasta (=the three contigs? where is this?), generates scaffold connections, write dot, write fasta (=scaffolds? just the two contigs?), write gfa (the three contigs), polishes gfa (but doesn&rsquo;t write it?? &ndash; re do with no polish. )</p>

<p>[Note: discussion Qu: to join or not join contigs]
[Note: further investigate: is this ambiguity (ie the join between the two contigs) due to structural heteroplasmy?]</p>
<h5 id="polish-the-assembly-with-short-reads">Polish the assembly with short reads</h5>

<p>note that the coverage is quite uneven, but that these reads could have bias as they are those that mapped to a certain set of cp genomes. If this new genome has new bits, these may be in the long-read assembly but missing in short reads.</p>
<p>Why would the polished assembly (the ref track) be different to the reads - wouldn&rsquo;t these snps correct these places? maybe would need another round+ of polishing.</p>
