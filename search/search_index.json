Genome assembly is the process of joining together DNA sequencing fragments into longer pieces, ideally up to chromosome lengths. The DNA fragments are produced by DNA sequencing machines, and are called \u201creads\u201d. These are in lengths of about 150 base pairs, to up to a million (or more) base pairs, depending on the sequencing technology used. Currently, most reads are from Illumina (short), PacBio (long) or Oxford Nanopore (long and extra-long). It is difficult to assemble plant genomes as they are often large (for example, 3,000,000,000 base pairs), have many repeat regions (such as transposons), and may be polyploid. This tutorial shows genome assembly for a smaller data set - the plant chloroplast genome - a circular chromosome about 160,000 base pairs long. The process shown here is applicable to assembling plant nuclear genomes but there would be extra steps (and much more time) involved. For example, additional sequencing would usually be run on 10X, BioNano or HiC to produce information to link up longer nuclear chromosome pieces and to separate out the maternal and paternal haplotypes. What\u2019s in this tutorial? The chloroplast genome of the sweet potato has been sequenced. This has produced many sequencing reads - DNA fragments. We will try to join these reads together to make the whole chloroplast genome sequence. We will use the Galaxy Australia platform (a web page) to run our analysis. This tutorial assumes some familiarity with Galaxy and bioinformatics - if you are new to either of these, we recommend the Galaxy Australia Training tutorials Get started, Learn key tasks, Quality control, Genome assembly, and Genome annotation , as this chloroplast genome assembly tutorial is slightly more complicated. You can follow all the steps, or skip the optional steps: Get data \u2192 Read quality \u2192 Assemble\u2192 Polish \u2192 View reads \u2192 Annotate \u2192 Repeat with new data Get data Log in to Galaxy Australia and create a new history. The data is from this paper: Zhou C, Duarte T, Silvestre R et al. 2018 , hosted at EBI ENA. Original FASTQ reads: Illumina (SRR6828568) and Nanopore (SRR6828567). These data sets have been highly reduced in size for this tutorial. In a new browser tab, go to this webpage at this link . Find the file called sweet-potato-chloroplast-illumina-reduced.fastq Right click on file name: select \u201ccopy link address\u201d In Galaxy, go to Get Data and then Upload File Click Paste/Fetch data A box will appear: paste in link address Click Start ; click Close The file will now appear in the top of your history panel. Repeat for the Nanopore reads sweet-potato-chloroplast-nanopore-reduced.fastq . We now have two FASTQ read files in our history. Click on the eye icon next to one of the FASTQ sequence files. View the file in the centre Galaxy panel. Read quality Optional. Skip this section for a quicker tutorial In the tool panel, search for Nanoplot [to do - run details] [to do - results] what does it mean, see sweet potato nanoplot - why is weighted histogram of read lengths have some that are in negative?/ eg NanoStats / average read length = 7000 / av quality = 10 / 2000 reads / 13 million bases Assemble Assemble: In the tool panel, search for \u201cflye\u201d, and click on \u201cAssembly of long and error-prone reads\u201d. For Input reads select sweet-potato-chloroplast-nanopore-reduced.fastq Leave other settings as default, except for estimated genome size add 160000 Click Execute View assembly outputs: There are five output files. View the log file and scroll to the end. How many contigs were assembled? What is the length of the assembly? View the assembly_info file. What are the contig names? What does the \u201cgraph_path\u201d show? The assembly sequence is in the scaffolds . Re-name this flye-assembly.fasta Optional: Download the Graphical Fragment Assembly Open the Bandage program (add link). Go to File: load graph then Draw graph What is your interpretation of this assembly graph? [to do - check the lengths of these graph contigs match the lengths in the flye output files] [to do - check the contig naming - note that it is changed in bandage?] Polish Short illumina reads are more accurate the nanopore reads. We will use them to correct errors in the nanopore assembly.

Re-name the fasta output file polished-assembly.fasta Find and run the tool called \u201cFasta statistics\u201d on this file. How does it compare to the unpolished flye-assembly.fasta ? View reads Optional. Skip this entire section for a quicker tutorial We will look at the original sequencing reads mapped to the genome assembly. In a new browser tab, go to this webpage at this link . See the two files with the \u201c-tiny\u201d in their file name. These are very cut-down files of sequencing reads. Upload these files to Galaxy, like we did in the first tutorial step, \u201cImport the Data\u201d. Map the reads: Map the Illumina reads (the new \u201ctiny\u201d dataset) to the polished-assembly.fasta , the same way we did before, using bwa mem. This creates one output file: re-name it illumina-tiny.bam Map the Nanopore reads (the new \u201ctiny\u201d dataset) to the polished-assembly.fasta . The settings will be the same, except Select analysis mode should be Nanopore .
